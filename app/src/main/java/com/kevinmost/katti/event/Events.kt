/**
 * Because we're using Kotlin:
 *
 * 1) All of our events can go in one file and still be accessed in the same way as if they were
 *    multiple top-level classes in Java class files.
 *
 * 2) We don't need to write any of the boilerplate to save into public final fields from the
 *    constructor; just put a "val" in front of every field in the primary constructor.
 *
 * 3) We can use data-classes, which are more efficient!
